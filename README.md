# Java Data Structures

This project implements various data structures in Java including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap.

## MyArrayList

The `MyArrayList` class implements a dynamic array that can dynamically resize itself as elements are added. It provides methods for adding, accessing, and removing elements.

Example usage:

MyArrayList<Integer> list = new MyArrayList<>();
list.add(10);
list.add(20);
int value = list.get(0); // Returns 10
